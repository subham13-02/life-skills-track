### Question 1
#### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

**Answer:-** The best idea here is to start with small habits instead of trying big changes all at once. There are three parts to habits: the cue (what starts it), the routine (what you do), and the reward (what you get). By just slightly changing one of these, you can form good habits more easily. It's a great way to make habits.

### Question 2
#### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

**Answer:-** In the Video of BJ Fogg's "Tiny Habits Method," B = MAP stands for Behavior equals Motivation, Ability, and Prompt. 

 If I want to start a new habit, like exercising. Here's a simple trick: think of B = MAP. 'B' is my behavior, like working out. 'M' is motivation – why do I want to exercise? The clearer my reason, the better. 'A' is ability – make it super easy, like a short workout. Finally, 'P' is prompt – set a reminder or link it to something I already do, like exercising after brushing my teeth. Following B = MAP makes forming new habits way easier!"

### Question 3
#### Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?
**Answer:-** Celebrating after doing a habit is important because it makes your brain like the habit more. When you feel good about doing something, you're more likely to keep doing it. BJ Fogg says if you celebrate after each small win, it becomes a habit. So, by adding a happy moment after doing a habit, you're telling your brain, "Hey, this is good!" and it helps the habit stick.

### Question 4
#### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

**Answer:-** The most interesting idea here is about making tiny improvements, like 1% better, in everything you do. It's like how a cycling team got way better by making small changes in lots of areas. This shows that even small habits and improvements can add up to something really big over time. So, the message is, don't underestimate the power of small, consistent steps—they can lead to major success!

### Question 5
##### What is the book's perspective about Identity?
**Answer:-** The book "Atomic Habits" says that to make good habits stick, think about becoming the kind of person who does those habits. It's not just about reaching goals; it's about making habits a part of who you are. Small changes add up over time, so focus on being consistent and creating a positive identity around your habits.

### Question 6
#### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
**Answer:-** The book "Atomic Habits" suggests making habits easier by breaking them down into four stages: cue, craving, response, and reward. It emphasizes creating an environment that makes habits attractive, satisfying immediate cravings, and ensuring they are easy to start and continue. The idea is to simplify habits and make them enjoyable, increasing the likelihood of consistent and successful habit formation.

### Question 7
#### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
**Answer:-** The book "Atomic Habits" doesn't specifically talk about making habits harder, but it suggests focusing on creating an environment that makes good habits easier and bad habits more difficult. For instance, if you want to stop snacking, you might keep unhealthy snacks out of reach. The idea is to set up your surroundings to help with good habits and make it a bit tough for bad ones.
