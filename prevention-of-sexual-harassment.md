### 1. What types of behaviors lead to sexual harassment?

**Answer**: Sexual harassment can be categorized into two main types.
- Quid Pro Quo (this for that):
    - This typically involves someone in a position of power-seeking sexual favors in exchange for job appraisals and bonuses.

- Hostile Work Environment:
    - This occurs when repeated, unwelcome, and unwanted sexual comments create discomfort, making the entire work environment untenable.

### 2.  What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?
**Answer**:
- If I see something wrong, I'll tell to the higher authorities.
- I'll let the person doing the wrong stuff know it's not okay.
- If I'm around, I'll step in to stop the bad behavior.
- If I were a witness, I would intervene to stop the harassment to make sure they need help or not.
